hierarchical-clustering-java
============================

Implementation of an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm in Java. Different linkage approaches are supported:
* Single Linkage
* Complete Linkage

What you put in
---------------

Pass a distance matrix and a cluster name array along with a linkage strategy to the clustering algorithm:

    String[] names = new String[] { "O1", "O2", "O3", "O4", "O5", "O6" };
    double[][] distances = new double[][] { 
        { 0, 1, 9, 7, 11, 14 },
        { 1, 0, 4, 3, 8, 10 }, 
        { 9, 4, 0, 9, 2, 8 },
        { 7, 3, 9, 0, 6, 13 }, 
        { 11, 8, 2, 6, 0, 10 },
        { 14, 10, 8, 13, 10, 0 }};

    ClusteringAlgorithm alg = new DefaultClusteringAlgorithm();
    Cluster cluster = alg.performClustering(distances, names,
        new AverageLinkageStrategy());

Alternatively, you can pass a [pdist](http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/pdist.html)-like matrix containing one row:

    String[] names = new String[] { "O1", "O2", "O3", "O4", "O5", "O6" };
    double[][] pdist = new double[][] {
				{1, 9, 7, 11 ,14 ,4 ,3 ,8 ,10 ,9 ,2 ,8 ,6 ,13 ,10}
		};
    ClusteringAlgorithm alg = new PDistClusteringAlgorithm();
    Cluster cluster = alg.performClustering(pdist, names, new MinimumLinkageStrategy());

What you get out
----------------

The algorithm creates a *Cluster* instance representing an hierachy of cluster nodes based on their distances.
You may want to visualize the result using the Swing component *DendrogramPanel*:

    DendrogramPanel dp = new DendrogramPanel();
    dp.setModel(cluster);

When embedded into a JFrame the dendrogram panel should display this:
